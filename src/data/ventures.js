    details: `2017. Peak VR hype. Everyone and their mom thought headsets were about to replace reality.

Built multiplayer VR experiences for large corporate events and conferences. Synchronized 50+ person experiences. Custom environments. Real-time interaction. Bleeding edge stuff.

Clients loved the demos. The tech was genuinely impressive.

Then the hype crashed shortly after. Enterprise VR budgets evaporated overnight. Wrong timing. (I still love VR.)

RIP Glimpse. You were ahead of your time. 🪦`

    details: `Started flying drones for fun. A realtor friend asked me to shoot a listing. She paid. Her friends wanted in. Their friends wanted in.

Became the go-to production company for luxury real estate. The client list got absurd:
• Selling Sunset, The Oppenheim Group, Million Dollar Listing
• Ryan Serhant, Fredrik Eklund, Aaron Kirman, The Altman Brothers, Josh Flagg, Tracy Tutor, James Harris, David Parnes, Tomer Fridman
• THE ONE in Bel Air when it listed for $500 million
• Even Mr Beast
• $50B+ in aggregate property value

Built real infrastructure. Multiple offices. Petabyte-scale storage clusters. Learned a lot about high volume operations and mission critical infra for a media production house.

Spun off the corporate IR side into Lumara Media.

This one hit. 👍`

    details: `COVID hit. Nobody could tour properties in person. Light bulb moment: digital twins.

Built photorealistic 3D environments. Interactive floor plans. Measurement tools. The whole virtual showing experience.

The tech was solid. Clients were impressed. The problem?

Every project was custom. Manual capture. Manual processing. Enterprise sales cycles took 6-12 months. Revenue was lumpy. Growth was capped by human hours.

Expensive lesson learned: if your business requires you to show up for every dollar, you've built yourself a job, not a company.

Shut it down. Took the L. Moved on smarter. 📚`

Blackstone, Greystar, Fortress, Hines, Stockbridge. The biggest RE investment firms on Earth. Fortune 500 clients. Earnings calls. Investor days. ESG content. The buttoned-up stuff.

Turns out when you stop trying to be everything to everyone and just do one thing really well, things work better.

Still running. Still profitable. Imagine that.`
